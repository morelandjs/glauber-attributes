  CERN-LHC.  This publication describes the methods used to measure the centrality of inelastic Pb-Pb collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 2.76 TeV per colliding nucleon pair with ALICE. The centrality is a key parameter in the study of the properties of QCD matter at extreme temperature and energy density, because it is directly related to the initial overlap region of the colliding nuclei. Geometrical properties of the collision, such as the number of participating nucleons and number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, are deduced from a Glauber model with a sharp impact parameter selection, and shown to be consistent with those extracted from the data. The centrality determination provides a tool to compare ALICE measurements with those of other experiments and with theoretical calculations.

  $N_\mathrm{part}$ for Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV with the corresponding uncertainties derived from a Glauber calculation. The ${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm data} \rangle}$ are calculated from the NBD-Glauber fit to the VZERO amplitude, while the ${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm geo} \rangle}$ are obtained by slicing the impact parameter distribution. ${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm data} \rangle}$ is also calculated for two variations of the AP, i.e. moving it to 91 % (${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm data +} \rangle}$) and to 89 % (${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm data +} \rangle}$) respectively. The last three columns report the discrepancies between ${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm geo} \rangle}$ and ${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm data} \rangle}$ and ${\langle N_\mathrm{part}^{\rm data} \rangle}$ with the uncertainty of the AP.
